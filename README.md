## 📖 About This Project

This is my personal developer portfolio, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Flutter Developer. It is built as a clean, modern, single-page application (SPA) using **vanilla HTML, Tailwind CSS, and modular JavaScript (ES6)**.

The project emphasizes a clean UI/UX, subtle micro-interactions, and a clear separation of concerns by splitting each logical section into its own self-contained JavaScript module.

## ✨ Key Features

This portfolio is packed with modern web features to create an engaging user experience:

* **🎨 Fully Responsive Design:** Looks and works great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **🌌 Interactive Particle Background:** A dynamic `HTML5 Canvas` particle background that subtly animates and interacts with the user's mouse (repulsion effect).
* **🌟 Scroll Animations:** Elements fade and slide into view as you scroll, powered by the `ScrollReveal.js` library.
* **✍️ Dynamic Typing Effect:** A "typing" animation in the hero section cycles through key skills.
* **🎠 Project Carousel:** A touch-friendly, autoplaying project slider built with `Swiper.js`.
* **🔍 Project Detail Modal:** A clean modal pops up to display detailed information, images, and links for each project.
* **🗂️ Interactive Experience Tabs:** A tabbing system to cleanly organize and display work history.
* **🔄 3D Flipping Contact Card:** A 3D card in the contact section that flips on hover to reveal the contact form.
* **📬 AJAX Contact Form:** The Formspree contact form is submitted via JavaScript's `fetch` API without a page reload, providing instant validation and success messages.
* **✒️ Animated Form Inputs:** Modern, Material Design-inspired form fields with an animated underline on focus.
